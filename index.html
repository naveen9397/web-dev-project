    <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">An aurora[a] (pl. aurorae or auroras),[b] also commonly known as the northern lights (aurora borealis) or southern lights (aurora australis),[c] is a natural light display in Earth's sky, 
        predominantly seen in high-latitude regions (around the Arctic and Antarctic). Auroras display dynamic patterns of brilliant lights that appear as curtains, rays, spirals, or dynamic flickers covering the entire sky.[3]
      Auroras are the result of disturbances in the Earth's magnetosphere caused by the solar wind. Major disturbances result from enhancements in the speed of the solar wind from coronal holes and coronal mass ejections.
       These disturbances alter the trajectories of charged particles in the magnetospheric plasma. These particles, mainly electrons and protons, precipitate into the upper atmosphere (thermosphere/exosphere).
        The resulting ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents emit light of varying colour and complexity. The form of the aurora, occurring within bands around both polar regions, 
        is also dependent on the amount of acceleration imparted to the precipitating particles.

    <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The Mercedes-Benz G-Class, colloquially known as the G-Wagen[3] (as an abbreviation of Gel√§ndewagen), is a four-wheel drive luxury SUV manufactured by Magna Steyr (formerly Steyr-Daimler-Puch) in Graz,
         Styria, Austria and sold by Mercedes-Benz. Originally developed as a military off-roader, later more luxurious models were added to the line. In certain markets, it was sold under the Puch name as Puch G until 2000.
  The G-Wagen is characterised by its boxy styling and body-on-frame construction. It uses three fully locking differentials, one of the few passenger car vehicles to have such a feature. Despite the introduction of an intended replacement,
   the unibody SUV Mercedes-Benz GL-Class in 2006, the G-Class is still in production and is one of the longest-produced vehicles in Daimler's history, with a span of 44 years. Only the Unimog surpasses it.[4] In 2018, Mercedes-Benz
    introduced the second-generation W463 with heavily revised chassis, powertrain, body, and interior.

    <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">New York, often called New York City[b] or NYC, is the most populous city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of New York State on one of the world's largest natural harbors,
         the city comprises five boroughs, each coextensive with a respective county. New York is a global center of finance[11] and commerce, culture, technology,[12] entertainment and media, academics and scientific output,
          the arts and fashion, and, as home to the headquarters of the United Nations, international diplomacy.[14][15][16][17][18]
    With an estimated population in 2023 of 8,258,035[5] distributed over 300.46 square miles (778.2 km2),[4] the city is the most densely populated major city in the United States. New York City has more than double the population of Los Angeles,
     the nation's second-most populous city.[19] New York is the geographical and demographic center of both the Northeast megalopolis and the New York metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area in the U.S. by both population and urban area. 
     With more than 20.1 million people in its metropolitan statistical area[20] and 23.5 million in its combined statistical area as of 2020, New York City is one of the world's most populous megacities.[21] The city and its metropolitan area are the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States. As many as 800 languages are spoken in New York City,[22] making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world. In 2021, the city was home to nearly 3.1 million residents born outside the U.S.,[19] the largest foreign-born population of any city in the world.[23]
